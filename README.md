# Analysis Projects in R
In this repository, you will find a collection of data science portfolio projects that showcase my skills and experience. 
These projects range from data cleaning and visualization to machine learning and deep learning models. 
I've completed these projects using R, which is one of my preferred tools for data analysis and visualization, 
particularly when robust statistical analysis is needed
